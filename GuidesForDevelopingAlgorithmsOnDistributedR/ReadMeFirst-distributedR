ABOUT vRODBC
------------
  vRODBC is an ODBC client which provides database connectivity  to the R environment. vRODBC is an HP Vertica enhanced version of the RODBC open-source ODBC client. vRODBC provides significantly faster data transfer rates from HP Vertica to systems running R-instances than RODBC for many types of data.  vRODBC provides significantly better data load performance than RODBC for data sets including numeric values, floating point numbers and boolean values.  For Character data types, you can also achieve better data load performance with vRODBC if you load the data in your R-environment as 'characters' rather than 'factors'.  Note that you must set the R-env option stringsAsFactors to FALSE to obtain better character data load performance.
