## inputFile: the input file which contains the complete adjacency list of a graph
## nSplits: the desired number of partitions in the graph. It may change based on the total number of vertices
## outputPath: it is the path for storing the output split files, it should be similar for master and workers
## isNFS: TRUE indicates that outputPath is on NFS; therefore, only one copy of files will be sent the destination.
##          When it is FALSE (defualt) a copy of the files will be sent to every node in the pool
